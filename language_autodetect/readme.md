# Language Autodetect

Opencart has a small piece of code that is responsible for autodetecting yuour browser language. if it finds one, it will check to see if this language is avalible in OpenCart language list. If true, it will display that language instead of the default OpenCart language.

## Fix

This is a small fix that removes that language detect code from being triggered.
